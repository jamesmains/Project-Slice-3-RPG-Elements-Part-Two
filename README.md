## Dynamic Equipment
Extending from [Project Slice 1](https://github.com/jamesmains/Project-Slice-1-RPG-Elements), I made the project in 3D so that applying models and meshes for equipped items would be easier since no additional art assets would be required. So when armor is equipped, it appears and animates. Weapons do the same but an added feature is that they affect the weapon animation when swung.

## Lock On System
Taking inspiration from Dark Souls, I added a mechanic to allow lock on to enemies so the player can move around them. It's a bit crude in this verison but was interesting to make nonetheless.
